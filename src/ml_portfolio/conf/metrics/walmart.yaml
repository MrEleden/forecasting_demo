# Standard metrics for Walmart sales forecasting evaluation.
# Uses MAPE as primary metric for optimization stability.
#
# ==============================================================================

# Primary metric for model selection and early stopping
primary_metric: MAPE  # Use MAPE for optimization (stable and interpretable)

# Whether to minimize the primary metric
minimize: true

# List of metrics to compute during training and evaluation
metrics:
  - _target_: ml_portfolio.evaluation.metrics.MAPEMetric
    name: MAPE
    epsilon: 1e-8

  - _target_: ml_portfolio.evaluation.metrics.RMSEMetric
    name: RMSE

  - _target_: ml_portfolio.evaluation.metrics.MAEMetric
    name: MAE

# Note: MAPE is used as primary metric for hyperparameter optimization
# as it's stable, interpretable, and generalizes well across different scales.
